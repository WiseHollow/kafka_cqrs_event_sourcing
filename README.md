# Kafka Demo Using SpringBoot + MySQL + MongoDB + REST API + Docker

## Why?
The industry is more and more leaning on Kafka as a way to reduce complexity of large scaled microservice solutions. The advantages are serious and I wanted to get further exposure. 

### Requirements
1. Docker & Docker Compose
2. A way of sending POST & GET requests to rest API. Examples: Postman, Insomnia
3. MySQL Database Instance
4. MongoDB Instance
